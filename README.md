# My Learnings

## Tools

* How to write notes using Markdown : [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* Quickly type HTML using Emmet `ul>li.item$*5` : [Emmet Cheat Sheet](http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)
* Github
  * Either takes existing project (local system for example) and import into Git
  * Do `git init` which creates .git hidden folder that maintains versioning of local files
  * Then create a new repo in github.com which will give a command similar to `git remote add origin https://github.com/braincap/fresh.git`. This is a remote which needs to be run in local system cmd; inside the working folder where init was done. This connects local repo to server.
  * `git add .` to add all files in the folder to staging area. Only these files will be committed
  * `git commit -m "informational message"`  then commits all files in staging area and confirms local changes
  * `git push` then pushes all files to git server in github.com. Give your git account's credentails to connect to github server
  * `git status` anytime keeps checking status of local
